                  Francis Ford Coppola's mafia epic remains a landmark in
                  filmmaking. With its unforgettable performances by Marlon
                  Brando and Al Pacino, richly layered script, and haunting
                  score, The Godfather continues to impress critics and public
                  alike.

                  More than just a gangster film, it is a reflection on power,
                  loyalty, and the American dream gone wrong. Its
                  cinematography, use of silence, and family-centered narrative
                  structure influenced generations of filmmakers.

                  Christopher Nolan's Inception is widely regarded as one of the
                  most innovative and intellectually ambitious films of the 21st
                  century. At its core, it's a heist film—but one that takes
                  place entirely within dreams, creating a multilayered story
                  that challenges audiences while delivering spectacular action.

                  The film's visual achievements are equally staggering. Scenes
                  unfold in rotating hallways, folding cities, and collapsing
                  dreamscapes—all achieved through a masterful combination of
                  practical effects, CGI, and physics-defying set pieces.

                  Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a landmark in global cinema, not
                  only for its historic achievement as the first non-English
                  language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also for
                  the way it captivates audiences across cultural and linguistic
                  boundaries.

                  What begins as a clever con gradually spirals into a cutting
                  meditation on class disparity, and the film observes how
                  poverty can transform but also bind the poor. The script
                  brilliantly weaves humor, heart, and social commentary.
